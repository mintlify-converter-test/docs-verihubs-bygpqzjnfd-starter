WhatsApp Session Message are the messages you send after a customer reaches out to you and you want to reply. A 24-hour session window opens during which you can freely converse with the customer through the WhatsApp Business channel without being restricted to the use of pre-approved template messages. Every time the customer replies the session window refreshes and it resets for another 24 hours.
