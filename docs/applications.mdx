This will be your first step to the services after you have [signed up](/docs/greetings)
 and verified your email address.

Done?

**Then let's follow the next step.**

The **Application ID** and **Application Key** _(or to be called **API Key**)_ are needed to access our API. Or, if you want to try demo on dashboard at least you will have to have one. The settings for your services are also saved on the specified application ID.

# Creating Application

After signing in to Verihubs Dashboard, click on Application menu on [side bar](/docs/sidebar-menu)
. You will see two tabs : [Sandbox](/docs/sandbox)
 and Production.

Tabs on Application

## New Registered User

If you are a new registered user, you can only make Application ID on Sandbox mode. The Application ID under [Sandbox mode](/docs/sandbox)
 _can only be use in Verihubs API testing_. If you want demo access or planning to go live, you can contact our Sales Representatives by clicking on the Contact Us button.

## Existing User

If you are an existing user or have granted access for Production, you can create Application ID on both Sandbox and Production mode. Application ID on Production mode can be used for demo on dashboard or API (with limited quota) and to go live whenever you're ready to sail with us.

## How to Make Application ID

*   Click _+New Application_ button on the upper right.
*   Input a name for your application and click _Add Now_ button to add your new application.  
    Your application name will be created with an auto-generated application ID.

<Warning>

## Important! ðŸŽˆ

Once you click on _Generate New Key_ it will generate a random auto-generated key that you will have to remember **(or copy it in a note, of course!)**. When you click the _Copy and Close_ button you will not be able to view it again.

But no worries, you still can generate another key when you miss one.

</Warning>

_Voila_!
