Verihubs OCR WebSDK aims to make identity card information input easier and provides comprehensive UI for seamless integration for your application.

## Technical Design

To prevent bad users from using too much OCR, we provide easy user authentication for limiting the usage of OCR. The `App-ID` and `API-Key` can then be inserted by the Proxy.
