title: "FastAPI"

It is recommended to create a virtual python environment to isolate python package installations with the local python packages. To do this, create a new `venv` python environment in a folder/directory.

```shell shell
python3 -m venv .venv

```

A new `.venv` folder/directory will be created in your current directory.

<Info>

## Info

If `python3` doesn't exist, try `python` or `py`, or check your python executable installation, and run the python installation you wish to use.

</Info>

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command in a folder/ directory containing the `.venv` folder/directory:

```windows windows
.venv/bin/activate

``````windows windows
source .venv/bin/activate

``````windows windows
source .venv/bin/activate

```

After creating and activating the python virtual environment, you can then proceed to install the needed packages to start the FastAPI server, with the following command:

```shell shell
pip install uvicorn fastapi

```

After installing the needed packages, a file can then be made, with the following content:

```main.py main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import Response
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from requests import post

app = FastAPI()

origins = ["*"]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)


@app.post("/liveness/face")
async def passive_liveness(request: Request):
    response = post(
        "https://api.verihubs.com/proxy/liveness/face",
        headers={
            "App-ID": "<replace-me-with-app-id>",
            "Api-Key": "<replace-me-with-api-key>",
        },
        data=await request.body(),
    )
    return Response(
        status_code=response.status_code,
        headers=dict(response.headers),
        content=response.content,
    )

```

Replace the endpoint with the correct endpoint, and replace `<replace-me-with-app-id>` and `<replace-me-with-api-key>` to the App-ID and APIKey provided for your company.

The proxy middleware can then be run using this command:

```shell shell
uvicorn main:app

```

<Info>

## Info

You can specify which port to serve the proxy middleware by adding `--port <port-number>` as an argument to the command.
