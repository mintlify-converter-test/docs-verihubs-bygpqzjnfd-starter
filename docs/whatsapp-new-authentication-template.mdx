The template content will have a preset content which supports a couple of options which are:

*   Security Disclaimer: For your security, do not share this code.
*   Expiration Warning: This code expires in `expiration_time` minutes.

And will have a button, either of:

*   Autofill : **When pressed**, automatically fill the authentication code into your app. ( Android only, if the autofill is not available on the end-user device, it will fall back to `Copy Code` button )
*   Copy Code: **When pressed**, copy the authentication code to end-user's clipboard

The authentication code will still be able to be seen on the message that has been sent to destination number.
