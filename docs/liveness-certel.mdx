title: "Liveness-Certel"

Liveness detection is the ability of a system to detect if a face is real or fake. Here are some examples of performing liveness:

1.  Only one face exists in the image sent
2.  The face in the image must not be blocked by anything, i.e., take off masks, sunglasses/light reflection on glasses, hat
3.  Make sure the image has good quality (avoid blur & dark)
4.  The minimum resolution of the image is Height: 640 x Width: 480
5.  Minimum size for each image: itâ€™s recommended to be 200kb with minimum quality is JPEG 90%
6.  Avoid backlight
7.  Avoid taking images in a dark environment
8.  No editing on the image
    *   prioritize for users to directly capture face images from mobile phone camera
    *   do not compress or crop the image
    *   do not add any elements to the image, i.e., padding

Case examples:

1.  Look straight (face should be looking straight)

2.  Lighting condition (avoid taking images in backlight or low light conditions. It may reduce the visibility of the facial features)

3.  Orientation (the orientation of the face should be portrait with the correct orientation)

4.  Face in the center (the face should be in the center to avoid half-face images which might lead to no face detected)

5.  Background condition (avoid taking the image in a crowded background as it might affect the result)

6.  No attributes covering the face (avoid wearing attributes or anything that cover your faces such as sunglasses/glasses with light reflection, face masks, hat, and hair)

7.  No blur (the blurrier the face photo, the less liveness accuracy)

8.  Not holding any identity card.
