Here are some of the best practices for taking **Selfie Photos** and **ID Card (KTP)** for ensuring seamless transaction in Electronic Certificate Issuance.

## Selfie Photo Best Practice

To help the process of checking images run optimally, here are some examples of right and wrong in taking selfies:

1.  Showing the whole face (eyes, nose, and mouth) and having good lighting

2.  Selfie sample that cannot be processed: The user's face is partially/fully blocked by other objects (KTP, full masks, etc)

3.  Selfie sample that cannot be processed: Multiple faces in one frame and a selfie is taken from another device (image from another phone/screen)

4.  Selfie sample that cannot be processed: Selfie taken is too far or too dark

## KTP Photo Best Practice

1.  Make sure the photo of KTP is clearly visible

2.  If your mobile application has border, make sure the KTP is inside the border.

3.  KTP sample that cannot be processed: The card is physically broken

4.  KTP sample that cannot be processed: The photo is a blur

5.  KTP sample that cannot be processed: KTP photo is edited

<img className="block" src="images/files_readme_io/_fa54deb_small_image17.png" alt="" />

6.  KTP sample that cannot be processed: KTP photo is black & white (photocopy)

7.  KTP sample that cannot be processed: KTP is NOT inside the border of your mobile application.
